we made a vr app that uses images to show the user where they are on the map, these images can be updated where ever the user clicks an arrow . this is done by the cursor event function.

we used the text component to make 3d text 


we also made a vr shooting game and a game that lets you fly a plane.  we made the plane be able to collide with the birds and gain score using the onCollision event.



we also used the Aframe cursor event function to change screens using only one click, we also used keyboard events to make a certain entity move in the Plane Simulator


we used Tinkercad to make 3d models for our vr games

vr follows ecs=entity component system
